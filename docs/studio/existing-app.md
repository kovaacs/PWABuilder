# Converting Existing Web Apps to PWAs

If you have an existing web app that you want to convert to a progressive web app, you can use PWABuilder Studio to add the necessary pieces to your app.
Every [installable PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps/Installable_PWAs) needs a web manifest and a service worker in order to be ready to be published on app stores.

PWABuilder Studio comes with tooling for adding both manifests and service workers for your web application. After you've added both, you can also use the extension to [validate](/studio/package?id=validate-your-pwa) that your PWA is properly store-ready.


## Add a Web Manifest

?> **Note** We're going to add a manifest and service workers using the PWA interface, but you can just as easily run the command by hitting `ctrl-shift-P` and searching `PWABuilder Studio: Generate Web Manifest`.

To add a manifest using the interface:

1. Click the PWABuilder Studio icon on the left side of the VS Code Window.
   
2. One the left side of your Code window, you should see the PWABuilder Studio UI.
   
3. In the "Web Manifest" section, click the `Generate a Web Manifest` button.
   
4. Select a location for your web manifest. 

5. Your new manifest will automatically open and hitting `Tab` will allow you to navigate between fields to edit.

6. Your manifest is automatically linked to your index.html

7. Fill out your manifest to match your application. You can learn more about the Manifest fields [here.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest)


Next up: adding a service worker! 


## Add a Service Worker
This tutorial also uses the interface to create a service worker, but can also be done by hitting `ctrl-shift-P` and searching `PWABuilder Studio: Generate Service Worker`.

The extension uses [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) to generate a Service Worker. Workbox is a helpful tool for creating and managing service workers that abstracts away a lot of the complexity.

1. Tap the PWABuilder icon on the right side of the VS Code Window

2. Tap the `Generate Service Worker` button

3. Choose a `basic` or `advanced` Service Worker.
The basic service worker will work for most cases and will ensure your PWA works offline. If you want to add your own code to your service worker, choose the advanced option.

4. The Workbox CLI will be installed and will run `workbox wizard`. This command is used to learn about the structure of your PWA for [pre-caching.](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching#what_is_precaching)

5. Follow the CLI prompts.


After filling out the prompts, Workbox will generate a Service Worker for you and add the register code to your `index.html`:

```html
<script>
    navigator.serviceWorker.register("public/sw.js")
</script>
```

Be sure to check out the [Workbox documentation](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-cli#setup_and_configuration) for more information about Workbox and service workers.

## Generate Icons

Currently, PWAs running on different platforms, such as Windows, Android and iOS all require different sized icons for your PWA to display properly. The PWABuilder Studio extension can help you generate the correct sized icons for your application, using your existing 512x512 sized icon and add them directly to your manifest.

To generate icons:

1. Ensure you have a web manifest. See the [validation documentation.](/studio/package?id=validate-your-pwa)
   
2. Hit `ctrl-shift-P` with Code open.
   
3. Search for and run the command `PWABuilder Studio: Generate Icons`.
   
4. The generate icon panel will open up and ask you to select a base icon. This icon is used to generate all the correctly-sized icons for your PWA. You can also tweak options such as icon padding and background color.
   
5. Click `Generate Icons`.
   
6. Your icons will be automatically added to your web manifest.

## Generate Screenshots

App stores and the browser install prompt will also use Screenshots of your app. The PWABuilder Studio extension can help you generate the correct sized screenshots for your application, using the URL to your deployed app, and add them directly to your manifest.

To generate icons:

1. Ensure you have a web manifest. See the [validation documentation.](/studio/package?id=validate-your-pwa)
   
2. Hit `ctrl-shift-P` with Code open.
   
3. Search for and run the command `PWABuilder Studio: Generate Screenshots`.
   
4. The generate screenshot dialogue will open up and ask you to enter the URL to your app.
   
5. Click `Generate Screenshots`.
   
6. Your screenshots will be automatically added to your web manifest.
