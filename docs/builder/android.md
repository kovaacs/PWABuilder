# Publishing PWAs to the Google Play Store

PWABuilder’s Android platform utilizes the [Bubblewrap tool](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/bubblewrap) to generate a [Trusted Web Activity (TWA)](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/android/trusted-web-activity/) that can be installed on the Google Play Store. This TWA behaves like any other Android application and is a great way to ship your PWA to the Google Play Store.

## Prerequisites

Before you can package for the Google Play Store, you will need:

* A valid PWA with a web manifest, published to the web and secured through HTTPS
* A Google developer account ($25)
* An android device or Android emulator for testing

Once you have checked all these boxes, you are ready for packaging!

## Packaging

The first step is to generate your Android package with PWABuilder:

1. Navigate to PWABuilder.com.
   
2. Enter the URL of your PWA on the homepage.

</div>

3. Click `Package for stores` to navigate to the package selection page.
   
4. Click on `Generate Package` in the Android section.

5. Make sure you are on the `Google Play` tab and fill out the required options for your package.
   
6. Click `Download Package`.

## Configuration Options

There are a ton of options you can configure when packaging for Android. Here's a breakdown of what each property means:

| **Display mode** | `Standalone` means your PWA takes up all the area except Android status bar and Navigation bar and `Fullscreen` hides both bars, which is intended for immersive experiences likes games and media playback.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **Signing key** | How the APK app package will be digitally signed: <br><br> `None`: your app package won’t be signed. Unsigned packages will be signed by the Google Play Store. This is Google’s recommendation, and our default. <br><br> `New`: PWABuilder will create a new signing key for you. The signing key will be included in your zip download. Choosing this will let you fill in details like password, alias, and more. <br><br> `Mine`: Upload an existing .keystore file to use for signing the app package. This should be used if you are updating an existing app in the Store. You’ll be prompted to specify your existing key passwords and alias. |
  
## Publish

There are a few steps to take before your PWA is ready to be published. All the files you need to complete these steps are contained in the `.zip` file you downloaded from PWABuilder.

#### 1. Deploy the assetlinks.json file
Your zip file contains assetlinks.json. This is a digital asset links file that proves ownership of your PWA. 

To properly deploy this file, upload it to your server at `https://<URL to your PWA>/.well-known/assetlinks.json`. 

?> **Note** Digital asset links are required for your PWA on Android. If you’re seeing a browser address bar in your app on Android, or if your app is crashing on launch, it means your assetlinks.json file is missing, inaccessible, or incorrect. See our asset links helper to fix this.

#### 2. Upload your app to the Google Play Store

Next, you'll upload your app package to the Google Play Console:

1. Log into the [Google Play console](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=androiddeveloper&passive=true&continue=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fconsole%2Fdeveloper%2F&_ga=2.66648750.1051416686.1651811327-1598367844.1601053784&_gac=1.56812888.1651811327.CjwKCAjw682TBhATEiwA9crl3yKK_grMWzVOA0JoU2P7-u8rnAIT0dEfclwuycEkxU5CK27UGzUZAhoC7McQAvD_BwE) with your developer account.
   
2. You can follow the guidelines on the Google play console to create your app. 
   
!> Be aware that PWAs on Android cannot currently target children as their audience. To avoid issues with your store listing, set the age rating to `13+` and specify `Target Audience: Older Users`.
   
3. Your zip file contains an .aab (Android App Bundle) file which can be submitted directly to the Play Store through the Google Play Console.
   

#### 3. Update your asset links file for production

This step is required for running the production version of your app. If you skip this step, your app will crash or a browser address bar will appear inside your app. 

1. Once you’ve uploaded your .aab file, Google Play re-signs your app. Because of this, you’ll need to update your asset links file.
   
2. Go to the Google Play Console and select your app release:

<div class="docs-image">
    <img src="/assets/builder/android/google-play-app-release.png" alt="Image of where to find your app release in the Google Play Console" width=700>
</div>

3. Click `Setup` and then `App integrity` in the sidebar. Navigate to the `App signing` tab and copy your SHA-256 fingerprint:

<div class="docs-image">
    <img src="/assets/builder/android/google-play-sha256.png" alt="Image of where to find your SHA-256 fingerprint in the Google Play Console" width=700>
</div>


4. Then, paste the fingerprint into your assetlinks.json file:

```json
[
    {
        "relation": ...,
        "target": {
            "namespace": ...,
            "package_name": ...,
            "sha256_cert_fingerprints": [
                "...",
                "PASTE YOUR NEW SHA-256 FINGERPRINT HERE"
            ]
        }
    }
]
```
    
5. Once your updated assetlinks.json file is deployed to your server, the address bar will disappear from your app.


#### 4. Save your signing key

Your zip file contains ```signing.keystore``` and ```signing-key-info.txt```. ```signing.keystore``` is the Android key store file containing the signing key.
```signing-key-info.txt``` is a text file containing your signing key information, such as the key password, store password, and key alias.
Keep both of these files in a safe place. You’ll need them to deploy future versions of your app. 

## Update Existing PWA

If you have an existing app in the Play Store and you want to publish a new version of it:

1. Generate a new package using the steps above.
   
2. Specify your new App version and App version code.
   
3. Scroll down to Signing key and choose `Use mine`
   
4. Choose your existing signing key file, and fill in your existing signing key information (key alias, key password, store password)
   
5. Build your package.
   
PWABuilder will build a package signed with your existing key. When you upload it to Google Play, it’ll automatically be recognized as a new version of your existing app.
