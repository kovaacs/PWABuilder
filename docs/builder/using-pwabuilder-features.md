# Using PWABuilder Features

In addition to packaging, the PWABuilder site also has some tools for improving your progressive web app and editing your manifest. This page will show you how to use the manifest editor, download a new manifest, and add that manifest to your progressive web app.

All the PWABuilder related tools can be accessed from the report card page. Take a look at the [PWABuilder Quick Start](/builder/quick-start) to see how to get started and navigate to the report card page for your app.

## Editing Your Manifest

To edit your manifest on the PWABuilder site:

1. From the report card page, select the `Edit Your Manifest` button.

</div>

2. The manifest editor modal will appear, allowing you to edit the fields of your manifest using a form.

3. The manifest editor has six tabs, each for editing or displaying a different part of your manifest:

   * `Info` contains manifest members that contain display information for your application.

   * `Settings` contains manifest members that manage how your application runs and displays at the most basic level. This includes how your applications is oriented, it's start URL, and other important options.

   * `Platform` contains manifest members that relate to how your application interact with native operating systems and app stores.

   * `Icons` allows you to generate proper icons for your progressive web app. See [Icon Generation]() for more details.

   * `Screenshots` allows you to generate screenshots to be displayed with your progressive web app in stores.

   * `Code` contains a preview of the manifest code that will be generated if you download your edited manifest.

4. Once you have edited and reviewed your manifest, you can download a copy to add to your PWA by clicking the `Download Manifest` button.

That's it! Once you've downloaded your manifest, you still need to add it to your progressive web app. Linking a manifest is quick and easy, and the next section will demonstrate how to do it with your newly generated file.

?> **Note** You can find an in-depth breakdown of all the members in the manifest editor on the [***Manifest Options***](/builder/manifest) page.

## Adding Your Manifest

Adding a manifest to your web app is easy and only requires adding a single line of code to your `index.html`.

To link a manifest to your app:

1. Either create your own or generate a manifest using PWABuilder.

2. Name the file `manifest.json` and add it to the root directory of your web project.

3. In your `index.html`, add this `link` tag that references your manifest:

```html
<link rel="manifest" href="manifest.json">
```

That's it! Your web app manifest should now be linked to your web app.

## Icon Generation

You can use the PWABuilder website to generate appropriate-sized icons for your progressive web app. Currently, PWABuilder supports generating the proper icons for Android, Windows, and iOS.

### Downloading Icons from PWABuilder

To get icons from PWABuilder: 

1. From your app's dashboard on PWABuilder, click `Edit Your Manifest`.

2. Navigate to the `Icons` pane using the top-level menu.

3. Click `Upload` and select an image you want to generate platform icons from.

4. Check/Uncheck which platforms you would like to generate icons for and click `Generate Zip`.

5. A zip containing your icons will be downloaded to your Downloads folder.

<div class="docs-image">

</div>

Next, you need to add references to the downloaded icons in your `manifest.json`.

### Adding Downloaded Icons to Your Project

To add generated icons to your project:

1. Decompress the zip archive you downloaded from PWABuilder.

2. Add the folder of images for each platform you generated at the same level as your `manifest.json`.

3. Finally, copy paste the icons field in the `icons.json` field into your `manifest.json`.

Once the folders have been included and the icons member has been added to your manifest, your new icons will be properly associated with your progressive web app.
