# PWA Starter Quick Start

## Prerequisites

There are just a few things you will need before getting started:

- A GitHub Account, which you can create at [GitHub](https://github.com/).
- A code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- A web browser, such as [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).
- [Node.js](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dev-environment/javascript/nodejs-on-windows)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Start a New App

?> **Note** You can also use our VSCode Extension, PWABuilder Studio, to generate a starter project. Go [here](/studio/quick-start) for more info.

To use the starter:

1. Visit the [PWA Starter repository.](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter)

2. Click the green `Use this template` button.

3.  Provide a repository name and other options you wish to include.

4. Click `Create repository from template`.

5. You will be redirected to your new repository!

Next, you just need to clone the repository to start developing. If you need help, check out these [docs.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

## Start Developing

1. Open a terminal of your choice at the root of your PWA Starter repo.

2. Install dependencies with `npm`:

```
npm install
```

3. After your packages are installed, deploy your PWA locally with this command:

```
npm start
```

4. Your PWA will open in the browser, running in development mode, and will automatically update when
   you make changes.
